In LibreOffice Writer, to start a new page, you can insert a page break. Hereâ€™s how to do it:
1. Using the Menu:

    Place the cursor where you want the new page to start.
    Go to the menu at the top and click on Insert.
    From the dropdown, select Page Break.

2. Using a Keyboard Shortcut:

    Place the cursor where you want the new page to start.
    Press Ctrl + Enter on your keyboard.

This will insert a page break, moving the content after the cursor to a new page.
3. Inserting a Manual Break with Formatting:

    Place the cursor where you want the new page to start.
    Go to Insert > More Breaks > Manual Break.
    In the dialog box that appears, select Page Break.
    Optionally, you can also choose a different page style if you want the new page to have a different format.

This method allows for more control, such as changing the style of the new page.

These steps will ensure that the content following the break starts on a new page.
